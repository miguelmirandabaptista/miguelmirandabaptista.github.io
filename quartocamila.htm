  You decide to search Camila's room, she is still crying, in the bathroom, so there should be no problem with this
  
<p/>
  
  As soon as you set your foot in her room, you find something that was not supposed to be there, it was a golf club, but Rodrigo was the only one in the house who played golf, maybe she was going with him... But they don't seem to have great affinity...
  
<p/>
  
  You wait for her, in the dark, she enters the room, and turn on the lights, she gets scared, seeing you there, and start to speak
  
<p/>
  
  "Wow!" - She says - "You scared me! Do you have something to do in my room? - She asks - "Because if it can help to find Melissa's murderer, take your time, and make yourself at home!" 

<p/>
  
  "Don't worry, I already found something, on this very room" - You answer, you can also see a glimpse of a smile on her face - "However" - The smile disappered - "It makes you, my suspect" - You say, showing her the golf club
  
<p/>
  
  "Ho-How dare you accuse me!" - She cries - "I would never do this to any one, but most of all, my best friend!"
  
<p/>
  
  "I want to believe you, but crying can sometimes be a sign of guilt" - You say, in a calm voice
  
<p/>
  
 "No! Wait, I can explain" - She shouts 
  
<p/>
  
  Now the girl could do anything to explain what happened

<p/>
  
Do you: 
  
<p/>  
  
<a href="quartocamila2.htm">Ask her for the explanation</a>

<p/>

<a href="pgevidencias.htm">Say that you need no explanation</a>

  You ask the kid to explain himself

<p/>
  
"It's a long story... This bracelet meant a lot for us..." - He says, you can feel like this is going to take too much time, so you interrupt him

<p/>
  
"We don't have much time" - You say - "Could you please say things quickly"
  
<p/>
  
"Of course" - He says - "Briefly, this bracelet was a message of love we had for each other, so the one who killed Melissa must have known that"
  
<p/>
  
"Oh, thank you for explaining fastly" - You say
  
<p/>
  
"Am I clear now?" - He asks
  
<p/>
  
"Only I can decide that..." - You make him feel like you're authority
  
<p/>
  
  You now have the knowledge of Melissa's bracelet!

<p/>

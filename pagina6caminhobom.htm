  You arrive at the house, and meet the three younglings, whose Melissa's father told you all about, you ask them their names, and, surprisingly, they answer quickly, - "I am Pedro, pleasure to meet you!" - Says one of them, you suspect that he has some kind of deep conection to Melissa, but you can confirm that later. - "I *sob* *sob* I-I am Ca-Camila *sob*" - Says another, she must have been Melissa's best friend, you think, and she has a guilty look on her eyes... But you can see it later. - "How are you doing sir?! I am Rodrigo" - Says the last one, being too friendly is very strange, and guilty people are the ones who oftenly do this... And since he is the last one, he has to be the biggest @$$#*!&, oh, that old man's bad manners are contagious, you think, he must be Melissa's fiance... <br> All of them seems to know something, and judging by the look on their eyes, they, just as you, know that the one who killed Melissa is at the house, but just stare at them won't do nothing, you must begin asking them questions

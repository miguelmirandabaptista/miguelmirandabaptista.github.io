  "Good morning Rodrigo" - You say, making a friendly start, so that you can earn the suspect trust
  
  <p/>
  
  "Good morning" - He says, he already said that, and it was already afternoon, maybe he was stupid, or didn't have lunch, or maybe, he was just doing what someone who knows something would do
  
  <p/>
  
  "Well, Mr. Rodrigo, I heard that you were Melissa's fiancee, am I right?" - You ask firmly, to assert your dominance
  
  <p/>
 
  "Yes, I was." - He says, coldly
  
  <p/>
  
  "Maybe you could tell me about what you did the day she died" - You say, staring at the guy whose bride was dead, and didn't show any sign of giving a damn about it
  
  <p/>
  
  "Of course" - He said, at least he is cooperating, you think - “I woke up really early, around 6 am. I did a few things related to my work, and a little later, when my sweetie woke up, we went shopping for food at a nearby market. When we got home, she prepared breakfast, at that time, everyone in the house had already woken up. So, after eating, I went to meet some friends, and I had lunch with them too, we spent the afternoon playing golf, until around 6:30 pm, at that time, I had returned home. I went straight to take a shower and grabbed something to eat in the kitchen, after I spent some time on my cell phone, and then I went to sleep, every day I sleep around 9 pm. That day, the only time I saw Melissa was when we went to buy food and eat breakfast. The other day, as I usually wake up early, I was the first to find my bride's body.”
  
  <p/>
  
  "Thanks for telling me the truth" - You say, still in doubt whether what he said was actually the truth
  
  <p/>
  
  "Anything that can bring justice to... To my bride *sob* *sob*" - He says, showing a bit of empathy, even if it is in a strange way
  
<p/>

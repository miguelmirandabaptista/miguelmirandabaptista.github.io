  As you are heading to the house, your phone rings, you answer it, you hear the voice of a man, and before you can even ask something, he says that he's Melissa's father, Gabriel, and he warns you about the 3 other residents of the house, or as he refer to them "the three useless brats", what a nice guy, you think, he makes lots of insults to his daughter friends, and surprisingly, her engaged one, who also lives at the house, and after a long time, maybe talking a lot is something from the family, thankfully you won't hear Melissa to prove it, he says that her daughter and the "biggest #@%!&*$", have been acting sus lately, and also says that the %@#!&*! have been insisting that his little darling made a life insurance, and on top of that, put him as a beneficiary. He also says that he expects you to do your !#@$%&* job.

What do you do:

<p/>

<a href="pagina6caminhobom.htm">I thank him for the information he gave me</a>

<p/>

<a href="pagina6caminhobom.htm">I ignore the bad words he said, and thank him for the information he gave me</a>

<p/>

<a href="gameoverbadass.htm"> Listen here you $!@#$@%&* &*&%$#!@#&%$ you better learn some %$#*&#@ respect, you know what? &@#!$ you and your useless daughter, whose !@#$ must have been used by, at least, 10 different guys, I will stop this case right now!</a>

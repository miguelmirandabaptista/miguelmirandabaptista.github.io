  You decide to search Pedro's room, I don't think he will have a problem with this, you think, as you enter the room
  
<p/>
  
  You search for a while, but you have found nothing, until you decide to search somewhere else, because as you are heading to the door, you see a beautiful bracelet, that must have belonged to Melissa
  
<p/>
  
  You wait some time, and Pedro arrives at the room
  
<p/>
  
  "Hey" - He says - "I didn't know you were here, have you found anything that can help you?"

<p/>
  
  "I don't know" - you answer - "Have I?" - You turn around for a bad-ass effect and show him the bracelet
  
<p/>
  
  "Oh, that is Melissa's bracelet, but why was it in my room?" - He asks
  
<p/>
  
  "I don't know, why don't you tell me?" - You say, in a deep voice
  
<p/>
  
 "I-I can explain!" - He shouts 
  
<p/>
  
  Now you have the boy at your hand

<p/>
  
Do you:

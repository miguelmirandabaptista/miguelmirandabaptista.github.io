 You accepted the case, then after thinking for a time about what you were going to say, you called the police, you explained them the case, you luckly remembered the address of where the victim was found, they said they would enter in contact with you, and so they did, they said that the body was found, the reason was that the victim hunged up herself in a fan, but it looked like someone or something had hit her head before, and the distance of the fan to the ground would not be enough to break her neck. <br> They ask you to go to the house, because now it is all up to you.

What do you do:

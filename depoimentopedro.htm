  "So, you are Mr. Pedro, am I right?" - You ask the young man
  "Yes sir!" - He answers
  "What kind of relationship did you have with Melissa? - You ask
  "I was her lover" - He answers, with an abnormal naturality
  "Well" - You say, still thinking why he did not make a big deal out of being someone's lover - "Start speaking son, what have you done in the day of the incident?"
  "With pleasure sir!" - He says - “In the morning, I woke up around 8:00 am, I spent a lot of time in my bed, using my cell phone, until around 9:00 am, when I went to have breakfast with the other people in the house. After eating, I went to the doctor for a routine appointment, which didn't take long. When I left, I went straight home for lunch, that day, Rodrigo didn't have lunch with us because he had left. After lunch, I decided to visit my mother's house, and I stayed there most of the afternoon. Around 4:00 pm I returned home, and I stayed in my room solving some work-related issues. While I was in my room, I saw Melissa come by twice to say hi. At 10:00 pm, we usually meet for dinner together, but that day nobody went to the kitchen, I thought it was strange, but I didn't care. I got something to eat and went back to my room, I don't know exactly what time I slept. The other day, I woke up hearing Rodrigo's screams. I suspect that Camila committed the crime, as she was clearly in love with Rodrigo, and by killing Melissa, she would have a clear path to be with him ”
  "That is all?" - He asks
  "I don't know, is it?"
  
  He seems to be speaking the truth, you think

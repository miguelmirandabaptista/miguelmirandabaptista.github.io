  You say it was Camila who did the crime, once again, she begs for your mercy, and says that it was Rodrigo who killed her best friend, and that she saw it all, and it was because of this fact that she was crying so much, Rodrigo denies doing it
 
<p/>

You notice that Camila was given many chances, and you start to wonder if it is something legit, or just a prank, made by I, the programmer
  
<p/>
  
This is your final chance, the other alternatives were removed, now, you have to use all your confidence, to try and get the right person in jail!

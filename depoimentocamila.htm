  "So, Miss Camila, what kind of relationship did you have with Melissa? - You ask, going straight to the point
  
  <p/>
  
  "I-I am... Was, Melissa's best friend... *wail* *wail*" - She answers
  
  <p/>
    
  This girl really was her best friend, you think, she is as tormented with Melissa's death as her parents!
    
  <p/>
  
  "So, could you please tell me what you did that day, well you know what day... That would help me a lot, and I'm the only one who can bring justice to your dead friend, but only with your help" - You say, gently, to show that she can count on you
  
  <p/>
  
  "O-ok" - The girl answers, drying the tears from her eyes - “I usually wake up late, especially on weekends. So I woke up around 1pm and went straight to lunch. When I arrived in the kitchen, Pedro and Melissa were together, that's when I found out they had an affair, but I preferred to pretend I didn't see anything. After lunch, Melissa and I stayed talking and watched a movie. Towards the end of the afternoon, I decided to go for a walk, when I returned home, I spent the rest of the time in my room, until I slept. The other day, I woke up with Rodrigo screaming, and then I saw Melissa's body. I know that Pedro will somehow blame me because we don't have a very friendly relationship, mainly because I already caught him and Melissa in the act”.
  
  <p/>

  "Thank you" - You say, and even tough she looks like one who speaks the truth, she also seems like hiding something...

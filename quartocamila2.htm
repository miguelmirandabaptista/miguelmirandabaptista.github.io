  You ask the miss to explain herself

<p/>
  
  "I was obliged to hide this club here" - She whispers

<p/>
  
"By who?" - You ask - "Please, tell it to me"
  
<p/>
  
"O-ok" - She says - "The one who made me do it, and also the one who killed Melissa..."
  
<p/>
  
"Wait, do you know who killed Melissa" - You ask
  
<p/>
  
Before she answered, you hear a loud bang outside the house, you go to see what was happening, it was just a bunch of teenagers, making stupid things, but because of this, and your accusation, Camila locked herself into her room, and began to cry once more, so you won't be getting anything else from her, unless you play the bad cop, but it would not help, anyways, and also don't make your style

<p/>  
  
You don't know whether what she was saying was true or false, only your heart can choose whether it is right or not to believe her

Who killed Melissa:

<p/>

<a href="gameoverpedro.htm">It was Pedro, I am sure of it</a>

<p/>

<a href="acusacaocamila.htm">It was Camila, It has to be her!</a>

<p/>

<a href="final.htm">It was Rodrigo who killed her, it is more than obvious</a>
  
<p/>

<a href="gameoverespecial.htm">It was a suicide all the time</a>

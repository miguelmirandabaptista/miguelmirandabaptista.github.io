The phone rings again, and you answer it this time, the one on the other end of the line is a woman, you notice that she is sad, probably because of something that happened to her <br> and also angry, probably because of you!

<p/>

What do you do:

<p/>

<a href="pagina3_5caminhobom.htm">I try to make her calm down by saying that the phone was low on battery, and I could only put it to charge now</a>

<p/>

<a href="pagina3_5caminhobom.htm">I say that the phone was on mute, and I only saw it now, by pure luck</a>

<p/>

<a href="gameover.htm">I say that I have nothing to do with this and hang up the phone</a>

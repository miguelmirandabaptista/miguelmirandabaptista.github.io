  You decide to look on Rodrigo's room, but as soon as you're going to open the door, he appears

<p/>
  
  "What are you doing sir?" - He asks, you are surprised on how much of a simpleton he is
  
  
<p/>

  "I want to search evidence on your room, so I can make a 100% sure accusation on who killed your bride" - You say, very patiently
  
<p/>
  
   "Sorry, but you won't be entering the room" - He says, with an angry voice tone
  
<p/>
  
   "You don't want justice made to your gone bride?" - You ask, while slowly approaching his face
  
<p/>
  
   "That's not it..." - He says, you think he could finally be understanding the seriouness of the situation, until he fineshes the sentence - "But you are not entering my room!"
  
 <p/>
  
  He will not let you enter the room, you can, however, use your authority, and open the door without his consent
 
 <p/>
  
What do you do now:

<p/>

<a href="quartorodrigo2.htm">I will open that door right away!</a>

<p/>

<a href="quartocamila.htm">I won't bother him, instead, I am going to search somewhere else</a>
  
<p/>
  
<a href="pgacusacoes.htm">I already have everything that I need...</a>

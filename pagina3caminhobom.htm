You manage to calm down the woman, she then proceeds to tell her story, her name is Carolina, a foreigner, you think, she tells you a lot of boring things that don't concern you, until she finally says the reason of her anguish, it happens that her daughter, whose name is... Was, Melissa, committed suicide, but she swears that her daughter was mentally healthy, and she thinks that someone was behind it, then she tells a lot of other dull details, and after a 2 hour long call, she appears to be relieved, she apologies for speaking so much, and asks for your help, since you are a detective.

What do you do:

<p/>

<a href="pagina4caminhobom.htm">"It would be a pleasure to help you, I know that getting the one who did it will not bring Melissa back, but it is certainly going to make you feel like justice was made!"</a>

<p/>

<a href="pagina4caminhobom.htm">"Since there aren't any other cases, I will accept yours"</a>

<p/>

<a href="gameover.htm">"You made me lose two HOURS of my life, I won't let you take any other second from me!"</a>
